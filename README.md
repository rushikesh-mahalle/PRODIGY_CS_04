# Keylogger

The Keylogger is a Python program that logs keystrokes by monitoring keyboard events using the `pynput` library. It captures each keystroke and saves it to a text file named `keylog.txt`.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Records each keystroke made by the user while the program is running.
- **Output to Text File:** Saves the logged keystrokes to a text file named `keylog.txt` in the same directory as the script.
- **Error Handling:** Handles exceptions gracefully, ensuring the program continues running even if an error occurs while logging keystrokes.

## Usage

1. Run the `keylogger.py` script using Python.
2. The program will start monitoring keyboard events and logging keystrokes.
3. To stop the keylogger, press any key.
4. Open the `keylog.txt` file to view the logged keystrokes.
